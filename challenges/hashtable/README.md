## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:
1. `add`
2. `get`
3. `contains`
4. `hash`

## Challenge

to fegure out how can I implement the provios methods to solve the contain and the get method 

## Approach & Efficiency

I had implement to method one for the get which take a key and using the hash method it will hash this provided key then we'll look if it's excite or not
and other method which is contain it will hash the key provided also if it's already excist it will retun true if not it will retun false.
