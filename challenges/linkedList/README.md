# Linked List

Write a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.

## Challenge

the most challenging part was with the `toString method` and still because I couldn't solve it or test it.

## Approach & Efficiency

class constructor & while loop

### the Big O is Big O Of(n)

#### `insert(value)`
- time: Big O Of(1)
- space: Big O Of(3)

#### `append(value)`
- time: Big O Of(n)
- space: Big O Of(3)

#### `insertBefore(value,newValue)`
- time: Big O Of(n)
- space: Big O Of(5)

#### `insertAfter(value,newValue)`
- time: Big O Of(n)
- space: Big O Of(5)

#### `includes(value)`

- time: Big O Of(n)
- space: Big O Of(2)

#### `toString()`
- time: Big O Of(n)
- space: Big O Of(2)
