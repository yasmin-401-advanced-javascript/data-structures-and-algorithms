# Reverse an Array
The JavaScript array reverse() method changes the sequence of elements of the given array and returns the reverse sequence.

## Challenge
writing a function takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
What I did is declared an empty array to push the index inside it, then in the `for` loop I made the `index` equal to the `array lenght` , `i` is more than 0 , and each time deduct one form the index **because it will start the loop form the last index in the array**
